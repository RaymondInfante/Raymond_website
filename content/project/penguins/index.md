### Predicting Sargassum Accumulation in the South of Puerto Rico

Pelagic Sargassum (*Sargassum fluitans* and *Sagrasum natans*) is a genus of brown algae, prevalent in the tropical latitudes. Since 2011, during late spring and summer high ammount accumulates on coastal areas of the Caribbean (Prakash et al, 2018). This algae tends to discompose in high concentrations bringing ecological and economical losses to the Caribbean Islands. 

This project is trying to create a machine learning model that predict the arrival of Pelagic Sargassum in the Southerly Coastal Water of Puerto Rico.

Sargassum travels the Caribbean from Africa, thanks to wind and ocean currents. 

Here some pictures of the accumulation of Sargassum in the west side (Isla Cueva) of La Parguera National Reserve.
