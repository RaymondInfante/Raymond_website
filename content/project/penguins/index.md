### Pelagic Sargassum accumulates microplastics in the ocean

Pelagic Sargassum (*Sargassum fluitans* and *Sagrasum natans*) is a genus of brown algae, prevalent in the tropical latitudes. Since 2011, during late spring and summer high ammount accumulates on coastal areas of the Caribbean (Prakash et al, 2018). This algae tends to discompose in high concentrations bringing ecological and economical losses to the Caribbean Islands. 

Additionally, it's been demonstrated that Pelagic Sargassum can accumulated microplastics (Carpenter and Smith, 1972). My hypothesis is that, due to bio fouling and water physics (Zhang, 2017), sargassum plastics could be separating from the sargassum patches and sinking trough the water column, contaminating the area it passes, putting in danger different ocean ecosystems.

Sargassum travels the Caribbean from Africa, thanks to wind and ocean currents. 

Here some pictures of the accumulation of Sargassum in the west side (Isla Cueva) of La Parguera Natioanl Reserve.
