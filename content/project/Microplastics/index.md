title: Microplastics Concentration on La Parguera and Guanica, Puerto Rico

### Microplastics Concentration on Surface SeaWater


Since the 1950s, society has relied on Plastics products due to their versatility, stability, and low-cost (Hale et al., 2020). The excessive purchase and one-time use of plastics have led humans to mismanage the waste and recycling process. As a result, plastics can be found all over the planet, from terrestrial to water ecosystems (Tulio & Rochman, 2020). There are several transport mechanisms by which plastics reach the oceans, such as litter mobilized by waterways or wind, illegal waste dumping, improper sewage management, and recreational activities (Chaukura et al., 2021). As a result, plastics undergo several mechanisms that can break them and transform them much smaller. Such mechanisms are bio, photo, thermos, and thermal degradation (Andrady, 2011; Sharma & Chatterjee, 2017). This produces microplastics in different forms, and the most commons are spheres, fragments, and the most frequent in the ocean, fiber. This results in plastics smaller than 5mm, called microplastics (Arthur et al., 2009).

Several studies have found that plankton (Sun et al., 2017), corals (Huang et al., 2021), seagrass (Seng et al., 2020), mangroves (Duan et al., 2021), sea urchin (Murano et al., 2020), fishes (Su et al., 2019), sea turtles, mammals, and humans (Meaza et al., 2021) had microplastics inside their system. The negative side of the story is that new literature has evidenced that microplastics could accumulate heavy metals such as Ni, Cd, Cu, and Pb (Catrouillet et al., 2021; Chaukura et al., 2021). In addition, microplastics can serve as an ecological habitat, harvesting microorganisms in what had been called a “Plastisphere.” The Plastisphere comprises algae, bacteria, viruses, and pathogens (Dudek et al., 2020; Zettler et al., 2013).

Microplastics have become a hazard to the marine community. For this reason, scientists must study the movement and concentration of microplastics. This research is being carried out to conduct a qualitative study by trying to answer if a seasonal pattern exists in microplastic concentration along the coast of La Parguera Reserve and Guanica Bay. This is important since many marine organisms live in these places, and many conservation efforts are carried out. There is a need in the literature to study microplastics in the water of Puerto Rico and the Eastern Caribbean. The research is a starting point to fill in the literature gap and start the study of microplastics in the seawater of the Caribbean.
