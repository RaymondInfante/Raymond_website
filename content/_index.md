description: I am a Master's student, researching the possible contamination of microplastics regarding the Pelagic Sargassum (*Natans* and *Fluitans*) in the [Bio-Optical Oceanography Lab](http://bio-optics.uprm.edu/) in the [Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez campus](https://www.uprm.edu/cima/). I'm also an enthusiast of aviation, certified as a UAV pilot. My research interest are in Remote Sensing of Ocean Color/processes using satellites and UAV, and using open source coding to answer questions of ocean contamination and movement.
