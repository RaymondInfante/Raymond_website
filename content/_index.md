description: I am a Master's student, researching the possible contamination of microplastics regarding the Pelagic Sargassum (*Natans* and *Fluitans*) in the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez campus. I'm also an enthusiast of aviation, certified as a UAV pilot. My research interest are in Remote Sensing of Ocean Color/processes using satellites and UAV, and using open source coding to answer questions of ocean contamination and movement.
